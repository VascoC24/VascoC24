## About Me

I'm a recent Computer Engineering graduate with a passion for cloud computing, software development, and solving real-world problems through technology. I enjoy learning new tools and technologies and applying them to build scalable and efficient solutions. My areas of interest include:

- ☁️ **Cloud Computing** (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud)
- 🛠️ **DevOps & Automation**
- 💻 **Software Development** (Backend/Frontend/Fullstack)
- 🤖 **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**
- 🛡️ **Cloud Security**

I recently earned the **Microsoft AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals)** certification, which has given me a solid foundation in cloud concepts and Azure services. I'm excited to continue growing in the cloud space and exploring advanced certifications.
